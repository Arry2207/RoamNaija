# 🚌 RoamNaija – Redefining Interstate Travel in Nigeria

**RoamNaija** is a digital travel companion that simplifies interstate journeys across Nigeria.  
It connects travelers with verified transport operators, provides real-time route insights, and builds a social experience around shared travel memories.

RoamNaija was inspired by the informal systems Nigerians already use — bus parks, WhatsApp groups, and word of mouth — and turns them into one connected, trustworthy platform.
